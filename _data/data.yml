    about: |
      _I am a recent graduate in Computation and Telecommunication Engineering.
      I consider myself and analytical individual with a passion for solving
      conjectures and theorems, extending beyond mathematics to include code
      and programming. Committed to excellence in fields such as engineering,
      programming and telecommunications. In general, my professional
      experience has spanned diverse areas and roles that served as a turning
      point in my career, allowing me to recognize programming and mathematical
      reasoning as my core talents, which I am eager to further develop and
      apply professionally._

    theme: |
      This theme has been inspired by
      [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/) color palette where some
      tones has been adapted, basically just shading it, however in future
      changes these would be modified following the
      [Dracula Syntax Highlighting Specification](https://spec.draculatheme.com)
      In the other hand, its under construction the Light-Dark color themes and
      functionalities proposing the light variation of Dracula. Another
      important mention is the base theme from which it was taken, it is
      [Online-CV](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv), and definitely it was
      a great beginning.

projects:
    title: Projects
    intro: >
      Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have developed some projects
      which generally reflect my interests and preferences across different
      kind of tools, technologies and topics in engineering.
    assignments:
      - title: Telegram Bot
        link: "#"
        tagline: "I developed this project using Python as a wrapper, hosted on DigitalOcean, and integrated with MariaDB as its primary database, with potential scalability to a Database as a Service solution such as AppWrite. The main objective of this initiative wasd to streamline the university student registration process via Telegram, facilitating acces to specific services. Upon student registration, an automatic email verification process was implemented to ensure identity validation. The project is designed with scalability in mind, with future plans to expand its capabilities through development in Swift and Kotlin. This expansion will provide seamless query options via both a dedicated application and the Telegram platform."

      - title: Motion Mouse Recorder
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Project based on the eKM8022 controller that has an essential feature feature to accomplish this project The XY Quadrature Mode. This mode would allow encoding the signal through a pair of optocouplers, and with a suitable sampling frequency, in conjuction with EEPROM module and a microcontroller, repeat the signal in a loop back and forth."

      - title: BMP Reader Writer files
        link: "https://github.com/RicardoUAMmx/BMP"
        tagline: "I am a passionate about C programming language, so I have carried out a reader writer of BMP files to implement the output images in a 8-bit games for microcontrollers such as PIC16F18875 or in a FPGA."

      - title: Github Pages Template
        link: "https://github.com/RicardoUAMmx/webcode"
        tagline: "I have been inspired by a template from another user to create my own so that it can be available to the community. A number of features have been addes such as Fixed Header, a moveToTop button, expand-contract divs. This project have been totally built in HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript; deployed by Docker on Github for Continuos Integration."

      - title: MSScripts
        link: "https://github.com/RicardoUAMmx/BMP"
        tagline: "Microsoft Scripts for PowerShell arose from the need to install WSL virtual machine on a different HDD or partition, which is not possible from the initial configuration (or if it is, it is quite complex). In general, it is simple for the user, just run the script and finally move the downloaded folder in the right address. Finally, run the Linux Image and the Job is done. I would remarked that it is possible to build a GUI environment for the user."

      - title: VHDL-Basic-Clock
        link: "https://github.com/RicardoUAMmx/VHDL-basic-clock"
        tagline: "I have always belived that there are different ways to solve a problem, some simpler than others, and it is quite normal to choose the simplest way, but in this particular project I have chosen the hard way, and for one reason, The omissions that we sometimes overlook. The project consists of a common clock on a 4-digit 7-segment display. The architecture mainly used was structural type. Each digit will change at its own time or in its case, it will turn on. Their respective counters were configured, the 4-digit display was multiplexed at 100Hz. The project was designed to implement a chess clock in VHDL."

      - title: Human Resources Network
        link: "#"
        tagline: "With a basic CRUD in Laravel with Docker, hosted on AWS ECS and Appwrite as DBaaS, the basic Web App will be done. An IOS app will be built in Swift for its integration with database in Appwrite. A Telegram Bot will be created for Online Support. (This project is under construction)."

      - title: Overleaf Templates
        link: "#"
        tagline: "A template like this document will be upload for everyone. All is built in LaTeX."
