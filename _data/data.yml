    about: |
      _I am a recent graduate of Computer and Telecommunications Engineering;
      however, my work life started much earlier than my professional studies,
      most of them in sales and services. I have had the opportunity to
      discover my social skills and test my persuasiveness as a salesman in
      companies such as IUSACELL (a telecommunications company in Mexico) and
      BANAMEX (currently CITI Bank). On the other hand, in the services
      industry, I have collaborated with VOLARIS (one of the most important
      airlines in Mexico) in their call center, with activities like flight
      reservations and especially hard flight attention that meant an
      enhancement to my resume. Also, in a BANORTE call center bank, my
      learning did not stop, especially because I could practice all my past
      skills. From the above, my collective skills of self-improvement,
      perseverance, resilience, and courage, would be proven by studying
      instead of leaving them behind, taking advantage of my experiences from
      before. Finally, and from a very special place, I would highlight my HSBC
      experience, where I could challenge myself in an important position as a
      KYC reviewer, where the details, concentration, intuition, knowledge of
      the retail market bank, technical skills and my passion for abstract
      reasoning were crucial, overall, my most important work experience_

    theme: |
      This theme has been inspired by
      [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/) color palette where some
      tones has been adapted, basically just shading it, however in future
      changes these would be modified following the
      [Dracula Syntax Highlighting Specification](https://spec.draculatheme.com)
      In the other hand, its under construction the Light-Dark color themes and
      functionalities proposing the light variation of Dracula. Another
      important mention is the base theme from which it was taken, it is
      [Online-CV](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv), and definitely it was
      a great beginning.

career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am an **analytic person** with a strong proficiency to solve abstract
      problems through my own passion and aptitude, and on the other hand, I
      have developed great **social skills** through my own environment in the
      past. Since my early days at Engineering Institute, I tested my code
      skills, and I loved it, probably because I had studied mathematics too
      and my HSBC past, so **I have developed for more than five years
      programming skills with different kinds of environments and languages.**
      All in all, we have with me **technical skills** particularly tested
      under a bank group, **sales and persuasiveness** to achieve goals,
      **customer contact and negotiation ability**, **abstract reasoning**,
      passion for **programming and mathematical thinking**, and especially
      **resilience**, among other things.
