    about: |
      _I am a recent graduate in Computation and Telecommunication Engineering.
      I consider myself and analytical individual with a passion for solving
      conjectures and theorems, extending beyond mathematics to include code
      and programming. Committed to excellence in fields such as engineering,
      programming and telecommunications. In general, my professional
      experience has spanned diverse areas and roles that served as a turning
      point in my career, allowing me to recognize programming and mathematical
      reasoning as my core talents, which I am eager to further develop and
      apply professionally._

    theme: |
      This theme has been inspired by
      [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/) color palette where some
      tones has been adapted, basically just shading it, however in future
      changes these would be modified following the
      [Dracula Syntax Highlighting Specification](https://spec.draculatheme.com)
      In the other hand, its under construction the Light-Dark color themes and
      functionalities proposing the light variation of Dracula. Another
      important mention is the base theme from which it was taken, it is
      [Online-CV](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv), and definitely it was
      a great beginning.
